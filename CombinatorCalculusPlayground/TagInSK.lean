--! # A tag system inside SK, end to end
-- Piece (v) is a tag-step driver. Before building one for a universal tag system — the hard construction —
-- this file runs the whole pipeline on the simplest genuine one, to find out whether the plumbing composes.
--
-- The choice of system is the trick. A tag system with deletion number `m = 1` over a one-symbol alphabet,
-- whose rule appends nothing, deletes one symbol per step and appends none: its words are determined by
-- their length, and it halts exactly when empty. That is `RS.Countdown` with `List.length` as the
-- isomorphism — so `Simulation.comp` with Stage 48's `countdownInSK` gives a `Simulation` from an actual
-- `TagSystem` into SK, with no new SK-side work at all.
--
-- What that is worth, stated up front: the pipeline composes, and a `TagSystem` is now hosted in SK by a
-- machine-checked `Simulation`. What it is NOT worth: a unary tag system is not universal, so criterion (a)
-- still wants a genuinely universal `T`, and that still needs a real driver.

-- ## What this settles, and what it does not
-- SETTLED: the pipeline composes. `Simulation.comp` was written in Stage 8 and never used on anything but
-- toys; it now carries a `TagSystem` into SK through two layers, and the tag system inherits BOTH of the
-- countdown's adequacy proofs for free, because composition does not care which `bwd` it is handed.
--
-- NOT SETTLED, and it is the whole of criterion (a): `unaryTag` is not universal. Deletion number one with
-- an empty rule cannot compute — it is a countdown wearing a tag system's clothes, which is exactly why the
-- composition was free. A universal tag system (Cocke–Minsky: m = 2 over a finite alphabet) needs the
-- driver to INSPECT a symbol and APPEND its rule, and neither happens here.
--
-- What this file does buy for that construction: it fixes the shape. Encode the word, simulate one deletion
-- per source step, and reuse the countdown's adequacy template — with the driver's extra work being the
-- symbol dispatch, which Stage 50 already measured as compatible with the K-normal-form abstraction, and
-- the rule append, which is untested.
