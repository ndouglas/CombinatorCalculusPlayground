--! # Bounded reachability for {S,C} is decidable (Stage 121)
-- The decidability program's first executable brick: a VERIFIED one-step successor function,
-- its soundness and completeness against `SCStep`, and the bounded-reachability closure with a
-- full correctness iff — so `∃ k ≤ n, StepsN k t u` is `Decidable`. The full-reachability
-- question remains exactly the bounded-intermediate question: these tools decide any region a
-- future intermediate bound pins down.

-- ## Stage 122: S-count conservation, and the pairing deadlock
-- Two yields. FORMAL: C-fires preserve the S-count exactly (they kill only their own C), so in
-- the C-fragment (S-count, leaf-count) evolve as (constant, −1 per step) — sharpening Stage
-- 117's conservation to a two-component invariant. ON PAPER (ledger): the member calculus now
-- PROVES the arrival-order pairing impossibility by deadlock — for `s` to head the final term,
-- both `a` and `b` must cross behind `s`, but a crossing's configuration `[C, machine, Y, s]`
-- forces the other variable to already be behind `s` (it cannot hide in the machine slot: vars
-- in argument position are bare, and var-headed members freeze wrong on unpacking) — so no
-- crossing can be first. Formalizing the deadlock needs the member-position calculus as a Lean
-- structure; the supporting laws land now.
