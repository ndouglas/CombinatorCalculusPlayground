# Lab Notebook — the Fable-vs-Lean meta-experiment

One dated entry per work session: what was attempted, what Lean resisted,
what automation could and couldn't do. This file is a first-class deliverable
(spec: if Stage 5 never terminates, the notebook is the result).

## 2026-07-23 — Stage 0

- Module split + census slice implemented: 9 tasks, 9 commits (~1 commit per
  task), each executed by a dispatched subagent with per-task review before
  the next task was dispatched.
- Proof friction encountered:
  - `stepOnce_sound` (Task 3): the plan's candidate script
    (`first | ... | simp_all`) failed because `simp_all` made progress
    without actually closing the descent-case goals. Fix: `fun_induction
    stepOnce t`, naming the binders explicitly in the descent cases. Proved
    by an Opus-tier agent.
  - `stepOnce` completeness / `stepOnce_isSome_of_step` (Task 4, the hardest
    proof in the slice): compiled on the *first* full attempt, by a
    Fable-tier agent. The `appR` descent case needed one extra step beyond
    the plan's script: `cases hst : stepOnce t <;> simp_all`. The plan's
    3-attempt escape hatch was never triggered.
  - `normalize_sound` (Task 5): the plan's induction-on-fuel candidate failed
    because the step count `k` wasn't generalized in the induction motive.
    `fun_induction normalize` worked, mirroring the Task 3 precedent — the
    second time in this slice that `fun_induction` succeeded where a
    hand-written induction principle didn't generalize enough on its own.
  - No `sorry` ever committed; zero-warning builds held throughout; every
    `#guard` passed as planned with one exception caught in pre-flight, not
    in a subagent run: a leftmost-wins guard in the plan itself expected
    `I x → x` in one step, when `I x` (i.e. `S K K x`) actually takes two
    steps to reach `x`. Corrected in the plan before Task 1 was dispatched.
  - Task 9 (this entry, the census runs themselves) hit its own piece of
    automation friction, worth recording as a tooling lesson rather than a
    proof one: `lake exe ccp 10 1000`, redirected straight to a file, was
    killed by a 10-minute timeout with **zero** output recovered — not
    because nothing had been computed, but because C stdio fully
    block-buffers stdout when it isn't a tty, so a `SIGTERM`'d process never
    flushes anything written to a redirected file. Wrapping the call in
    `stdbuf -oL -eL` (line-buffered) fixed recovery of partial output for
    subsequent runs. Separately, fuel=1000 turned out to be genuinely
    intractable at this term size within any reasonable budget — not a
    buffering artifact, since a fuel=1000 run at the *smaller* n=9 also
    exceeded 5 minutes partway through n=8 — so the census plan's fallback
    ("reduce fuel or size, say so") was exercised for real: the definitive
    numbers below come from `ccp 12 200` (fuel held at 200, size pushed to
    12), not `ccp 10 1000` as originally scripted.
- Census headline (see CONJECTURES.md for the full table and methodology
  caveats):
  - First fuel-exhausted terms appear at n=7 (2 of 132 terms, fuel 200);
    growth of the exhausted count is fast: 41 at n=8, 276 at n=9, 1484 at
    n=10, 6842 at n=11, 29337 at n=12 (of 58786 total n=12 terms).
  - No `CYCLE FOUND` line at any size, n=1 through n=12, fuel 200 — the
    S-cycle question stays open but unrefuted at these sizes.
  - Max reduction length among terminating terms (`maxSteps`) climbs from 15
    (n=7, n=8) to 174 (n=12) — reduction sequences get much longer well
    before any term fails to terminate at all.
  - Raising fuel from 200 to 1000 at fixed n=7 makes the fuel-exhausted
    candidates' final leaf count explode from 120112 to 25740409924 — real
    evidence of explosive (not merely slow) growth along those trajectories,
    though still not a divergence proof.
- Next: Stage 1 (confluence) / Stage 2 (conservation) / Stage 3 (taxonomy)
  are all unblocked per the DAG.
